#### Liberty Bell Slot Machine

The [Liberty Bell](http://bit.ly/2hrTtj6) was the first mechanical slot machine. It was created in 1895 by Charles Fey in San Francisco. The five-cent game had three reels and six symbols: diamond, heart, spade, horseshoe, star, and the Liberty Bell.

For some time I have been curious as to the "feel" of the gameplay on such an old machine. So built and programmed a replica using modern technology.

This was a fun project because it has everything: probability, statistics, gameplay, databases, analytical dashboards, buttons, LEDs, color displays, monochrome display, seven segment displays, sound, and historical significance.

More information is on the [Liberty Bell](projects/liberty-bell) project page.

#### Scene Stats and Global Graphs

Charts and graphs often show up in the [scenery](projects/scene-stats) of television shows and movies.

And I also spot them while I'm traveling around the [globe](projects/global-graphs).
