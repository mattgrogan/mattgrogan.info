This is a timelapse of images taken every ten seconds from my balcony in Astoria.

It shows the sun setting behind the Triboro Bridge and the local Astoria fireworks at dusk.

The camera also captures the famous beer garden at [Bohemian Hall](http://bohemianhall.com/)

Photos were taken using a [Raspberry Pi](https://www.raspberrypi.org/) with [Camera Module v2](https://www.raspberrypi.org/products/camera-module-v2) and stitched with [avconv](https://libav.org/avconv.html).
