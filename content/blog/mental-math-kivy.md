## Background

I wish I had found the book [_Secrets of Mental Math_](http://a.co/1Z2OBp4) when I was in elementary school. Fortunately late is better than never!

In the book, the authors detail techniques that I never imagined were possible. But I needed practice and for once I found that there _isn't_ an app for that...until now!

## Enter Kivy

[Kivy](https://kivy.org) is a Python user interface library for development of touch-based, modern UI applications.

One useful feature of Kivy is that you can copy the Python code to your Android phone's SD card and launch the app with the [Kivy Launcher](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=org.kivy.pygame&hl=en).

## The code

All code is available in the [MentalMath](https://github.com/mattgrogan/MentalMath) GitHub repository.
