I am trying to capture a good variety of these magnificent views before the end of summer, when the sun moves back towards the southwest.

Photos were taken using a [Raspberry Pi](https://www.raspberrypi.org/) with [Camera Module v2](https://www.raspberrypi.org/products/camera-module-v2) and stitched with [avconv](https://libav.org/avconv.html).
