### Background

[_Secrets of Mental Math_](http://a.co/1Z2OBp4) details some excellent techniques for doing complex arithmetic in your head. These techniques work great, but I needed practice and for once I found that there _isn't_ an app for that...until now!

### Enter Kivy

[Kivy](https://kivy.org) is a Python user interface library for development of touch-based, modern UI applications.

One useful feature of Kivy is that you can copy the Python code to your Android phone's SD card and launch the app with the [Kivy Launcher](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=org.kivy.pygame&hl=en).

### The code

All code is available in the [MentalMath](https://github.com/mattgrogan/MentalMath) GitHub repository.
